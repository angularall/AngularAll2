<h2>
ng-controller
</h2>
<p>
The ngController directive attaches a controller class to the view. This is a key aspect of how angular supports the principles behind the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
</p>
<p>MVC components in angular:

<ul> 
 <li> Model — Models are the properties of a scope; scopes are attached to the DOM where scope properties are accessed through bindings.</li>
 <li> View — The template (HTML with data bindings) that is rendered into the View.</li>
 <li> Controller — The ngController directive specifies a Controller class; the class contains business logic behind the application to decorate the scope with functions and values</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
<h2> Directive Info </h2>
This directive creates new scope.
This directive executes at priority level 500.
