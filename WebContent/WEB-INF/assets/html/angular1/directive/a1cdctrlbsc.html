<h2>
ng-controller
</h2>
<p>
The ngController directive attaches a controller class to the view. 
This is the very same behavior like Model-View-Controller design pattern.
</p>
<p>MVC components in angular:
</p>
<ul> 
 <li> Model - Models are the properties of a scope; scopes are attached to the DOM where scope properties are accessed through bindings.</li>
 <li> View - The template (HTML with data bindings) that is rendered into the View.</li>
 <li> Controller - The ngController directive specifies a Controller class; the class contains business logic behind the application to decorate the scope with functions and values</li>
</ul>
<h2> Directive Info </h2>
